abstract: This paper evaluates howthe July 2005 London terrorist attacks affected Muslim teenagers’ education plans and decisions. The attacks triggered a violent backslash against the Muslim community, which could have affected their incentives to continue in full-time education. I examine panel data on educational attitudes from the ’Next Steps’ Survey in England and use the month the survey was administered to divide individuals into treatment and control groups. I find that the attacks negatively affected the education plans of Muslims, but not those of any other major religious group. The probability of planning to continue in full-time education decreased by around 4.4 percentage points for Muslims after the attacks. This corresponds to a 69% increase in individuals who were not sure whether to continue or drop out of full-time education after the compulsory years. However, this change in plans appears to be a temporary reaction, since it did not affect students’ actual decisions 2 years later.
